## Technical Implementation

### Empty State Components
- Uses Activity and Send icons from Lucide React
- Consistent styling with app's black/white theme
- Call-to-action buttons with proper routing

### Message Ordering
- `transactions.reverse()` to show newest at bottom
- `useEffect` hook for auto-scroll on new transactions
- Smooth scroll behavior with `scrollIntoView`

### Animations
- Tailwind CSS `animate-in` and `slide-in-from-bottom` classes
- Staggered animation delays for multiple messages
- 300ms duration for smooth transitions

## Browser Testing
- Test on mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- Test scroll behavior on different screen sizes
- Verify animations work smoothly
- Check accessibility with screen readers
